# Automation project

#### Description

The repository contains basic projects for automation testing on **Kotlin/Java** and **TypeScript** with examples for **backend**, **frontend**, and **mobile**.

#### GitHub Actions

This branch `kotlin-junit5-retrofit` is integrated into GHA -> It passes test results to this branch `allure-pages` and hosts them using GitHub Pages

#### Frameworks 

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) - programming language based on JVM and fully compatible with Java! It's much easier than Java don't worry ;) 

[JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) - highly recommend reading about [DataProviders](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources) aka Sources

[Selenide](https://selenide.org/) - framework is a kind of wrapper based on Selenium WebDriver and is developed especially for testing purposes.

[Selenoid](https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/) - powerful `Golang` implementation of the original Selenium Grid farm. One configuration for the `localhost` and `remote` runs and easy to update and manage through `Docker` and `VNC` `(free)`. Also, they provide `paid` `Kubernetes` (`free` for 4 pods) solution [Moon](https://aerokube.com/)

[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - this is an API framework. It's much faster and easier than Rest-Assured. Also, you can try [Feign](https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign)

[Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest) - highly recommend using this framework as the main assertion framework for your project. This one [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) is good if you prefer Java.


# Report

[Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) - THE BEST test report framework ever! This framework supports the most popular languages and test runners. It's easy to integrate into almost any CI.

#### The most popular annotation: 

`@Step` - combine all steps (annotated methods) and generate a readable test report where you will see all the steps as text. Also, it adds variables with values to the step into the report.

`@DisplayName` - just JUnit 5 annotation which means a test name

`@Issue` - add a link to Jira (or any other system) to your report for the test

`@TmsLink` - add a link to TestRail (or any other system) to your report for the test

`@Severity` - add a marker as BLOCKER or CRITICAL into your report for the test

`@Flaky` - add a marker to the test as flaky in the report system

`@Epic` -> `@Feature` -> `@Story` - combine your tests into a tree and split them by epic | feature | story


[Allure EE](https://qameta.io/) - this is like Allure + TestRail + CI. [Documentation](https://docs.qameta.io/allure-ee/) with features and etc.

#### The main features: 

`Live documentation` - Allure EE keeps your test documentation updated based on test runs.

`TMS` - Allure EE supports both Manual and Automated testing. Unified test documentation allows you to manage and review all your product tests from a single view. Also, it has a lot of filters and you can create custom fields and filters.

`Integrations` - Allure EE is based on Allure and has the same integrations and many more with Jira and other systems.

`Metrics` - Allure EE supports many more metrics than Allure and you can integrate the system with Grafana and add custom metrics etc.

`Migration` - Allure EE supports test-cases transfer from any TMS like TestRail etc.

# How to run

#### Before start

You need to install `Selenoid and Selenoid-UI` and `Allure`

#### Notes

1. Those tests were split by `TAG` (annotation above test classes) and you need to check this before if you want to run only one group. 
2. If you want to run a few test classes please be sure you have free nodes for UI because all tests work in `PARALLEL` mode by class

#### Start

Run only one test group/tag: 

```bash
$ mvn clean test -D TAG=<tag name>
```
or
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean test -D TAG=<tag name>
```

Run all tests (UI and BACK):

```bash
$ mvn clean test
```
or
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean test
```
or
```bash
$ mvn clean test -D TAG=regress
```
[ONLY FOR UI] If you want to run the tests on the remote computer you need to transfer `HUB_URL` variable to the env:
```bash
$ mvn clean test -D TAG=<tag name> -D HUB_URL=<ip or host>
```

#### After tests

If you want to see the test report locally: 
```bash
$ allure serve target/allure-results
```
or
```bash
$ allure serve target/allure-results --host localhost --port 9999
```

If you want just generate the test report without web service run:
```bash
$ allure generate target/allure-results
```
Go to `src/allure-report` folder and click `index.html`

#### CI

If you use Jenkins or TeamCity and etc. the report will be generated automatically after a run and connected with this job. You will need just click on the Allure logo! 
  
### Allure + Grafana

**Allure** generates a report specially for **Grafana** and **Prometheus**

How to use it for **Grafana**:
  - Generate **allure-report** by `$ allure generate allure-results`
  - Install **InfluxDB** (use **Docker**)
  - Get a file for **InfluxDB** in `/allure-report/export/influxDbData.txt`
  - Install **Grafana** (use **Docker**)
  - Integrate **InfluxDB** to **Grafana**
  - Send the report to **InfluxDB** by 
  - `$ curl -XPOST 'http://<host>/write?db=<db name>' --data-binary @allure-report/export/influxDbData.txt`
  - Check **Grafana** 
  - ***PROFIT***
